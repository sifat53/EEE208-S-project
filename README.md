# EEE208S Active Noise Cancellation  
---

This project demonstrates the implementation of an **Active Noise Cancellation (ANC)** system using basic analog electronic components, including operational amplifiers (uA741), capacitors, and resistors.  

## Objective  
The goal of this project is to design and implement an analog circuit that reduces or cancels unwanted noise signals through destructive interference, leveraging the principles of signal inversion and superposition.  

## Components Used  
- **Operational Amplifier (uA741)**: Core component for amplifying and inverting signals.  
- **Capacitors**: For filtering and stabilization.  
- **Resistors**: For setting up the circuit's feedback and gain.  

## Design Overview  
The system works by capturing the noise signal and generating an inverted version of the noise. When this inverted signal is combined with the original noise, it cancels out the unwanted sound, effectively reducing the overall noise level.  

## Applications  
- Reducing background noise in audio systems.  
- Enhancing sound quality in communication devices.  

## Future Improvements  
- Incorporate digital processing techniques for improved performance.  
- Test the system in diverse noise environments.
